All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All participants were asked for and provided their informed consent. We performed a transcriptome analysis on PBMCs of 10 non-mosaic KS patients and 10 aged-matched healthy controls. All KS patients (mean age 32.5±3.0 years) had 47,XXY karyotype as shown by cytogenetic investigation conducted on at least 50 metaphase and five out of ten were treated with testosterone enanthate. Normozoospermic controls (mean age 32.0±3.0 years) had a negative history for genetic disease, normal testicular volume and normal reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, total testosterone) levels. Ten healthy age-matched women (mean age 32.0±2.9 years) were also recruited as female controls. All KS and male and female controls were Italians (Eastern Sicily) Heparinized venous blood sample was withdrawn from each KS and male and female control. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obteined using Ficoll-Paque (Ficoll Plaque PLUS - GE Healtcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, USA). Total RNA was extracted using the standard RNA extraction method with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Before use, RNA concentration in each sample was assayed with a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop) and its quality assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with Agilent RNA 6000 nano kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Indexed libraries were prepared from 1 µg/ea purified RNA with TruSeq Stranded Total RNA (Illumina) Library Prep Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were quantified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and pooled such that each index-tagged sample was present in equimolar amounts, with final concentration of the pooled samples of 2bnM",SAMEA104345989,E-MTAB-6107:Sample 13

For operated patients (with surgery), tumor cells were xenografted directly. however, for biopsy cells, they were grown in culture for 1 or 2 days, before transplanted to the nude mouse. The final xenografted cells will be collected when the tumor reach a size of 1 cm. Finally, the \Differentiation\, \Fibrosis\, \Inflammation\ information are estimated on the collected xenograft tissues. Total RNA was extracted using Manual-miRneasy Mini (Qiagen) Libraries were prepared using Illumina's guidelines for the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT sample prep kit. Fragmentation was done using the alternative fragmentation protocol in order to produce RNA-seq libraries that are compatible with sequencing on a paired-end 100 base pair flow cell (PE-100bp FC). The steps in library prep included o Capture of mRNA on oligo-dT-beads, Concomitant fragmentation and primer annealing, First strand synthesis, Second strand synthesis, 3' enzymatic steps resulting in end repair, 3' adenylation, and adapter ligation and Library amplification (PCR) . The strand specificity of the kit is achieved by the presence of dUTP instead of dTTP during the second strand synthesis step. Since the polymerase used in the downstream library amplification step does not incorporate past dUTP, the incorporation of this nucleotide in second strand synthesis effectively quenches the second strand during amplification. Libraries were QC'ed with respect to concentration and size profile: The size profile of the libraries was evaluated by QC of 8 of the samples on an Agilent DNA 1000 or high sensitivity chip. The libraries contain approximately 120 nucleotides of adapter sequence and the remaining size of the library is derived from the input RNA. The library concentration was determined using the KAPA qPCR kit (KK4835) and triplicate reactions using three independent 106-fold dilutions of the libraries.",SAMEA103909691,E-MTAB-5039:PDAC011T

DNA contaminants were digested with DNASE I (Ambion). The ventral half of the midbrain was dissected from second trimester prenatal brainstem under visual inspection, using a scalpel and hand-held dental drill. Cases were donated with informed consent of the mother, and were selected on the basis of the absence of any congenital anatomical abnormality on macroscopic brain inspection, and the absence of any major genetic defect noted on prenatal testing. The IRB approval is from the Western IRB, a private and fully accredited IRB that is used by many independent institutions in the USA: address 1019 39th Avenue SE Suite 120, Puyallup, WA 98374-2115. Study number: 1126332. WIRB protocol number: 20111080. Approval expires: 7/18/2016 RNA-seq libraries were constructed using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Ribo-Zero sample Prep Kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The ribosome RNAs were removed using Ribo-zero beads from ~ 800 ng DNAse treated total RNA. Following purification, the total RNA without Ribosome RNA was fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature (94 degree) for 2 minutes. Under this condition, the range of the fragments length is from 130-290 bp with a median length of 185 bp. Reverse transcriptase and random primers were used to copy the cleaved RNA fragments into first strand cDNA. The second strand cDNA was synthesized using DNA Polymerase I and RNaseH, dUTP in place of dTTP. These cDNA fragments then went through an end repair process using T4 DNA polymerase, T4 PNK and Klenow DNA polymerase, and the addition of a single 'A' base using Klenow exo (3' to 5' exo minus), then ligation of the Illumina PE adapters using T4 DNA Ligase. An index (96 unique dual-index pairs) was inserted into Illumina adapters so that multiple samples can be sequenced in one lane of 8-lane flow cell if necessary. These products were then purified and enriched with 15 cycles of PCR to create the final cDNA library for high through put DNA sequencing using the H 100 base-pair paired-end reads and the Illumina HiSeq 2000, targeting approximately 100M reads per sample. The concentration of RNA libraries was measured by Qubit (Invitrogen, CA). The quality of RNA-seq library was measured by LabChipGX (Caliper, MA) using HT DNA 1K/12K/HiSens Labchip.",SAMEA4051984,E-MTAB-4868:GIS_Prenatal_Midbrain_4

When disposed properly, the samples were put into 4℃ refrigerator for 24h so as to let the RNA store immerse them. After 24h the RNA store was abandoned and the samples were sopped up using sterile absorbing paper, then the samples were separately collected into new cryogenic vials and were store into -80℃ refrigerator for further investigations. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. QIAshredder was used for homogenization. The amount of total RNA extracted was quantified on a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer and RNA quality and purity was further evaluated using an Aligent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Aligent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US). RNA-Seq was performed by CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China).",E-MTAB-8181:12_B,12_B
